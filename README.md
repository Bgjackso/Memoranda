**MEMORANDA-PSP Project**

Memoranda-PSP is a new version of the personal organization tool for projects: Memoranda.

**Using MEMORANDA-PSP**

MEMORANDA-PSP is opened by simply clicking the runnable-jar file on a PC or Mac environment.

* Timer to track time on each task.


* Lines of Code Log for tracking LOC per day.


* Charts Panel for importing Defect and LOC for visual representation over a 30-day period.


* iCalendar export option added to the File drop-down menu for linking your MEMORANDA-PSP calendar to a Google Calendar or other calendar application so you get updates for anything on the MEMORANDA-PSP calendar.
